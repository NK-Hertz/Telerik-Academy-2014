/* Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given 
 * word.Example: The word is "in". The text is:
 * We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the 
 * submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of 
 * it in 5 days.
 * The expected result is:
 * We are living in a yellow submarine.
 * We will move out of it in 5 days.
 * Consider that the sentences are separated by "." and the words – by 
 * non-letter symbols.
