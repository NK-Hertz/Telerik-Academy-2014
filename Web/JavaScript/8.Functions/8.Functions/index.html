    <p id="textToUse" style="display:none">The Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by The
        Wachowski Brothers, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo
        Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived
        by most humans is actually a simulated reality called "the Matrix", created by sentient
        machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity
        are used as an energy source. Computer programmer "Neo" learns this truth and is drawn
        into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed
        from the "dream world".

        The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as "bullet time", in which
        the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action
        within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move
        through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science
        fiction genre. It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas,
        and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Jean
        Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in
        Wonderland. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration
        for Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight
        choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential
        upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions.

        The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999, and grossed
        over $460 million worldwide. It was generally well-received by critics,
        and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards
        and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects,
        cinematography and its entertainment. The film's premise was both criticized for
        being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing.
        The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others
        dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise.

        Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction
        films, and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for
        preservation. The success of the film led to the release of two feature
        film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, The Matrix
        Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The Matrix franchise was further expanded
        through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in
        which the Wachowskis were heavily involved.
